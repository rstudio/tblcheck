tblcheck provides functions for grading tibbles, data frames, and vectors with [gradethis](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/gradethis/). 

gradethis is designed for use with [gradethis](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/gradethis/) in [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) tutorials. We recommend that you first be comfortable grading [learnr](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/) tutorials with [gradethis](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/gradethis/) before you begin using tblcheck. You can learn more with the [gradethis package documentation](https://pkgs.rstudio.com/gradethis/) and the [learnr package documentation](https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/).

<img src="man/figures/screenshot.png" alt="A screenshot of the tblcheck package in action. An exercise starts with the following instructions: 'Create a tibble with two columns. The first column should be called &quot;fruit&quot; and contain the value &quot;tomato&quot;. The second column should be called &quot;color&quot; and contain the value &quot;red&quot;.' The student has entered the following code: 'tibble(vegetable = &quot;tomato&quot;, color = &quot;red&quot;)'. The tblcheck package generates the following message: 'Your table should have a column named &quot;fruit&quot;. Your table should not have a column named &quot;vegetable&quot;. Please try again.'" style="border: 1px solid black; box-shadow: 5px 5px 5px #eee; max-width: 66%; display: block; margin: 1em auto;">

## Installation

<!-- You can install the released version of tblcheck from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with: -->

<!-- ``` r -->
<!-- install.packages("tblcheck") -->
<!-- ``` -->

tblcheck is still in development and not on [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) yet. The development version of tblcheck can be installed from GitHub with:

``` r
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("rstudio/tblcheck")
```

## Usage

To use tblcheck in a learnr tutorial, start by loading tblcheck after learnr and gradethis in the `setup` chunk of your tutorial:

```` markdown
```{r setup}`r ""`
library(learnr)
library(gradethis)
library(tblcheck)
```
````

Then include one of the tblcheck functions in your gradethis code:

```` markdown
```{r exercise}`r ""`

```

```{r exercise-solution}`r ""`
tibble(fruit = "tomato", color = "red")
```

```{r exercise-check}`r ""`
grade_this({
  pass_if_equal()
  tbl_grade_table()
  fail()
})
```
````

`tbl_grade_table()` compares the `.result` generated by a students' code to the `.solution` generated in the `exercise-solution` chunk.

- If `tbl_grade_table()` detects a difference, it produces a failing grade with a message describing the problem with the table.

- If no differences are detected, `tbl_grade_table()` does not produce any output, so it works well as a first line of checks.
